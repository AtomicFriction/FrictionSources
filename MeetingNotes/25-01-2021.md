# 25 / 01 / 2021 Meeting Notes


### Points Discussed - Bartu
<!--- Important points that were discussed in the meeting. -->
- First movie. 
- Constrain implemented along coordinates.
- Globals read in the beginning in read_globals.

### Points Discussed - Cagdas
<!--- Important points that were discussed in the meeting. -->
- Working on neighbor table
- NT working for fixed BC
- Unified forces

### To Do 
- Implement "Analysis": e.g. Ndump, Ff, Etot, KE, PE, ? -> At the moment only implement the first two (C,B)
- L0 \neq zero: eq. length of the spring, take from user, default=0 (B)
- Thermostat relevant keywords (C): At the moment, all expected from user
- Langevin (C)
- Thermostat application mode: full, thermo_layer, atom_no (Think about this-> B,C), Only option in 1D is full.
- Load (H)
- Think about equilibrium positions of the substrate 
- Anharmonic terms (B,C):3rd and 4th terms have coefficients named k_cu, k_qu. Defaults needed.
- 1D with thermostat (B,C)
- Hessian (C,B,H)
