# 14 / 12 / 20 Meeting Notes 


### Points Discussed - Bartu
<!--- Important points that were discussed in the meeting. -->
- Got the 2D model to work.
- Also tried numba -> works much faster
- Thermo and run classes implemented.
- Dimension check implemented.
- Implemented main.
- How to publish a pip package. Very easy - need a wrapper. 

### To Do - Bartu
<!--- Things to do until next meeting. -->
- Check if numba is faster than vectorized algorithms
- Integrators
- Nsteps



### Points Discussed - Çağdaş
