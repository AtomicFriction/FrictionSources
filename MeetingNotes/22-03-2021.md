-   Arrays can be dealt with using loops + numba to avoid memory but no    
-   Hessian and eigenvectors done.
- Bartu:
-   Hessian checked.
-   Umbrella function for analysis
-   SimulateAgent, SimulateSubs
-   When slider gets out, move slider + agent to the beginning in PBC

-   A lot of protocols.

### To Do 
<!--- Things to do until next meeting. -->
- Think about the different characters of the thermostats, v vs F. (C)
